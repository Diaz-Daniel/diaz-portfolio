        <p>
          I am currently a Fleet Engineer for a Seattle based company. I worked
          as a deckhand for two seasons and then transitioned to the Engineering
          team. While the work can sometimes be dirty, and the issues diverse as
          they involve different boating systems; I have found process of
          problem solving to be the most enjoyable part of my job. From quick
          fixes to complex interconnected systems issues, the process of problem
          solving remains the same. Cultivating attention to detail and learning
          to ask better questions has always been an interest of mine.<br></br>
          Transistioning my career to web development feels seamless, because
          while the technical problems to be solved are markedly different- the
          process of finding solutions remains the same. I believe my projects
          are produced with the same attention to detail that I put into my
          current work as a Fleet Engineer.
