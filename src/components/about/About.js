            Web developer with a background in Engineering. I have over 15 years
            of work experience and earned my degree in philosophy at California
            State Northridge. I am completing my full stack certification
            through the University of Washington coding program focused on MERN
            stack development. <br></br>I currently work as a Fleet Engineer for
            a Seattle-based maritime company. While the work can sometimes be
            dirty and complex as they involve different boating systems, I have
            found tackling problems to be the best part of my job. From quick
            fixes to complex interconnected systems issues, the process of
            problem-solving remains the same and applies to my coding work. I
            have cultivated strong attention to detail and found unique ways to
            solve problems on boats and in code. In a recent website deployment
            project, I was the team leader and helped find solutions for every
            challenge we faced. <br></br>
            Transitioning my career to web development feels seamless because
            while the technical problems to be solved are markedly differentâ€“the
            process of finding solutions remains the same. I am looking forward
            to working at a company that promotes growth to expand my skills
            further while leveraging my experience.
